summary: "Engineers like to over engineer their own projects. And this blog is one of them. I recently moved this blog
over to Github Pages and am now using Jekyll to generate this blog. Additionally, I added Cloudflare because I wanted
to try out their service. In this post I'll explain what I did, how I did it and which issues I ran into."
